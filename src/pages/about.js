              <p>Hey there and welcome to my website!</p>
              <p>
                I’m an actor local to Atlanta auditioning all over the
                Southeast, but I made my journey to the fantastic HOT-Lanta
                after a 5-year stint in Los Angeles where I received a Theater
                Arts degree from The American Academy of Dramatic Arts and
                studied at UCB, iO West, The Ivanna Chubbuck Studio, and various
                other schools around town.
              </p>
              <p>
                If you’d like to see what I do, I perform on an improv team
                called Big Poppa on Thursday nights at Village Theater as well
                as on other teams like The Actor’s Worst Nightmare at Highwire
                Comedy!
              </p>
              <p>
                Along with acting, I write a{' '}
                <a href="//lifelesswasteful.com">
                  blog called Life Less Wasteful
                </a>{' '}
                about my journey to live with less trash, ‘cause we all could be
                a little kinder to the planet, y’know?
              </p>
